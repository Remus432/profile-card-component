## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Today's challenge was building this NFT preview card component. It was an easy and fun challenge to warm up for more advanced Frontend Mentor projects :)

## Development

With all the frameworks, libraries, plugins, and whatnot out there we feel like everywhere we turn we have to squeeze tons of new information in our brains.

Yet we forget that in frontend development, at the end of the day, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the building blocks of all the framworks and libraries out there. Knowing these three pillars are what contributes to a successful career in frontend development.

That's why I love going back to these simple, yet beautiful projects. 

There's no need for NPM modules, libraries, compilers. Just plain good ol' frontend code.

As a side note, I used SCSS just because I wanted to implement my BEM methodology and variables. You could easily do the same with plain CSS.

So, there's not much explanation to do for this project - a few images, text, and some transitions here and there.

Once you spend a few months practicing your skills, you realize how far you've gotten once you manage to build robust projects using best practices in record time.

Keep going - with each project you complete, you're getting closer to your dream! ;)
