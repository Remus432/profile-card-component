## Development

After taking such a long break from coding during holidays, contrary to my nature, I decided to start with a small challenge. Though I hadn't become completely rusty, this "prolonged no-coding session" definitely dampened my momentum. 

We shouldn't feel ashamed or embarassed about having to start small again after a break. It's healthier to begin in a small,but focused manner so you don't end up overwhelmed from the get-go.

Putting the life lessons aside, let's turn out attention to the project at hand.

I took this opportunity to use once again the power of Svelte and GSAP - truly, the more I use Svelte, the more fond I grow of this library. I don't intend to ignite a debate by any means because the usage of any given framwork / library is up to each one of us, depending on our needs and preferences. 

With that being said, I've personally used React and Vue as well and they all have their own strong points and working with all of these libraries has been a fascinating experience. 

What truly stuck with me about Svelte is its reactive and straightforward nature - coding a project with it feels intuitive and the potential for scalability is insane. 

You might find it a bit odd that I'm focusing my writing more on the technical side of these libraries, instead of the challenge itself, but I deemed this far more deserving of additional attention given the challenge I built isn't complex by any stretch of the imagination.

Because it was only a component, everything is contained within a single file - App.svelte 

I doubt it would've been necessary to have other Svelte files, let alone variables or mixins.

This challenge follows my usual structured style of building a frontend project, which is:

* Laying down the HTML BEM based foundation
* Setting up the basic required stylings
* Implement mobile-first design
* Implement responsive design for the other screen sizes
* Implement animations (sometimes I do it only for larger screen sizes to increase performance on mobile devices)

I have one Newbie challenge left to complete, which I hope I'll be able to share with you soon.

If you want a solid, beginner-friendly challenge to practice your HTML and CSS skills, I recommend you give this one a shot.

See you in the next challenge! ;)
